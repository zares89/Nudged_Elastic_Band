# Nudged_Elastic_Band
This is a code that calculates the minimum free energy path (MFEP) between the reactant and the product states defined in a 2-dimensional energy landscape. The energy landscape is calculated from a Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) Code (Grossfield, Alan, “WHAM: the weighted histogram analysis method”, version XXXX, http://membrane.urmc.rochester.edu/wordpress/?page_id=126). The method used to calculate the MFEP is called Nudged Elastic Band (Henkelman and Jonsson, J Chem Phys, 113, 9978-9985 (2000)). 

This code is used to calculate the MFEP and the activation energy for the dissolution of magnesium-hydroxide from the surface of forsterite, the magnesium end-member of olivine group. Same code is used to calculate MFEP for the dissolution of magnesium-carbonate surface complex on the surface of forsterite. For details, see (Zare, S., Funk, A., & Abdolhosseini Qomi, M. J. (2022).
